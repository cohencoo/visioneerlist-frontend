# VisioneerList - Join a community of visionaries and innovators

## About

VisioneerList offers a freemium platform that enables emerging innovative startups and entrepreneurs to connect & expand their visibility.

Simultaneously, by providing a platform that networks local Australians, we hope to increase employment opportunities for a wider age range, harnessing today's cutting-edge technology.

## Why?

Statistically, 42% of startup businesses fail, commonly due to costs involved in marketing and advertising. <i>(Business Startup Statistics Australia (2022 Update) | Fundsquire)</i>

Due to the high costs involved, many emerging businesses are deterred from mainstream advertising, which can stifle their firepower.

VisioneerList intends to alleviate the well-known hardship of marketing costs by targeting a niche, local market, offering a unique, versatile, online platform, that harnesses today's cutting-edge technology.

To run Frontend locally, you will need to have NodeJS installed.

1. Install Dependencies `npm i`
2. Run App locally `npm start`
3. Push any changes live `git add -A && git commit -m "updates" && git push`
4. Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages `npm run deploy`

Deploy scripts will create a `/build` directory, which will be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch of the Git Repo. This Branch is used for production release.

Ensure GitHub Pages doesn't unlink from the custom domain.
